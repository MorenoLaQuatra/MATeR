0	00PxVoeaY3YiNa6mP822S9	We continue our serialized examination of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West with the album’s second track “Gorgeous.” “Gorgeous” is undoubtedly one of Kanye’s strongest displays as lyricist and rapper.
0	00PxVoeaY3YiNa6mP822S9	There’s nary a wasted word on “Gorgeous” as Kanye seamlessly weaves cheeky pop culture references with poignant racial anecdotes and self-empowering affirmations.
0	00PxVoeaY3YiNa6mP822S9	It’s a blueprint to atonement, to overcoming uncontrollable forces with sheer grit, determination, and self-assurance.
0	00PxVoeaY3YiNa6mP822S9	Kanye seems less concerned with how to end racism and more concerned with how to overcome it, how to do great things in spite of it.
0	00PxVoeaY3YiNa6mP822S9	Layers of emotional and psychological complexity are added when we consider the song’s hook, an observation on Kanye’s psyche after the VMA backlash.
0	00PxVoeaY3YiNa6mP822S9	It subtly reveals that fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of losing it all are guiding, underlying principles in Kanye’s behavior.
0	00PxVoeaY3YiNa6mP822S9	It would seem for all his bravado, Kanye is not fully confident in his confidence, his ego a defense mechanism to adversity.

0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	I started over on my personal style a little over 2 years ago.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	Before that I didn’t have anything to wear that I felt confident in or that matched.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	I felt like it was holding me back as a petite woman in a design field.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	I started over with a basic color scheme and really a capsule of just the most basic items I needed to survive that season.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	Each item was made with fair-trade practices and quality in mind, so I spent more on those initial pieces that I ever had spent before.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	I had to tell myself that I’m paying for quality and craftsmanship, and I felt pride in what they made.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	I took care of those pieces and I still have most of them today.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	I started taking my OOTD photo every day on Instagram for a full year, and since then I’ve developed a closet that works together well.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	EVERYTHING matches.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	I no longer have cheaply made jewelry or fabrics that just fell apart on me anyway, and I did that with intention.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	So even though naturally I’ve expanded my collection over time, I’m never flippantly buying things that I’m going to throw away.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	So 5 fashion Items I’ve started investing in:   High Quality Fabrics  Gold or Brass Jewelry
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	Higher-end Lingerie  Versatile Shoes  High Quality Purses and Bags
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	These investments are almost all accessories.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	Invest in daily higher-end items that people won’t get sick of seeing you in.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	If you will be interacting with many of the same people every day, then I would avoid wearing anything easily recognizable like “Oh you’re wearing the polka-dotted hoodie with the bunny ears again”.  Investing in the right parts of your closet is important.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	Hopefully this is a good direction if you’re not sure where to begin.
0	00h18NlParejEuFrdCf5dC	Hopefully it helps you find the best return on your wardrobe investment.

0	00hxkvWZqYLJV76ruD8l6m	We often associate a life of luxury with money, but in a time-poor world is the most luxurious thing we can offer ourselves a little space?

0	00i0DCBy8w68h8NStQbi2j	In this meditation, we release a story (or many stories) that we tell ourselves.
0	00i0DCBy8w68h8NStQbi2j	Overtime, our perception of something about ourselves or someone else can start to look like the truth when in fact it is not.
0	00i0DCBy8w68h8NStQbi2j	The first step to changing our perspective is to see that we may be holding onto a story.
0	00i0DCBy8w68h8NStQbi2j	My hope is that the Truth Tree does this for you today.

0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	Why it’s always better to communicate your romantic interest immediately when you encounter a woman you want to date, instead of trying to fly under the radar by masking your interest as friendship in hopes that you can later turn a platonic relationship into a romantic one.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	In this video coaching newsletter, I discuss an email from a viewer who made the colossal mistake of hiding his romantic interest when he met a woman on tinder that he really liked.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	He randomly chatted and texted with her for over a month before asking her out on a date so they could actually meet in person.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	He went for the kiss on their first date, but she turned her cheek and he instead sheepishly took her hand and kissed it.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	On their third date he tried to kiss her again, but she rejected him and tried to friend-zone him.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	He told her he was not interested in that.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	He backed off.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	Then she contacted him a few days later.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	They made plans for his birthday.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	She blew him off and ignored him.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	Several weeks later after hearing nothing, he sent flowers to her work.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	She thanked him and gave him some BS excuse about being busy as to why she had not gotten back to him.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	Then she told him that she had been dating a coworker who was not happy about her getting flowers from him at the office.
0	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	He asks my opinion on what he should have done differently.
1	014kW85WWNtaCOtf0KoyAc	If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.

1	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	What is the most life-changing mindset?
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	The mindset of minimum thinking.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	A mindset where taking action is preferred over thoughts.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	How many times do you look for the right visualization, goal-setting motivational content?
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	We all want to fix our minds and we should.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	But it should happen with our actions.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	The more time you spend thinking, the less time you have to take real action.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	It’s tempting to think about how you will meet the one.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	Or live in that mansion.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	It’s not that tempting to go work on your business or approach a stranger.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	But the later is the one that will get you closer.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	No amount of thinking will get you your goals.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	Whenever I am caught up in my head I bring myself to actions.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	What action do I need to take to move closer to this goal?
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	Not visualizing, no affirmations but a real action step.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	What are the action steps in your life?
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	Want to get fit?
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	Eat a little healthier and exercise.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	Want to make money?
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	Learn a skill and then trade.
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	Want to make friends?
0	018Eohp6PKBfYx6wCyKVml	Talk to strangers.

0	019LoX6HPT5pfJfM3ek0ID	He knew this girl from high school and always wanted to date her, but he says he was too much of a coward to ask her out when he was younger.
0	019LoX6HPT5pfJfM3ek0ID	At a high school reunion he was able to use what he had learned from studying pickup skills to start dating her.
0	019LoX6HPT5pfJfM3ek0ID	However, she went from being all over him to backing away and then becoming totally unavailable.
0	019LoX6HPT5pfJfM3ek0ID	Then he found my work.
0	019LoX6HPT5pfJfM3ek0ID	After reading my book only once and not really taking the time to learn the fundamentals, she started responding positively, but since he really did not know what he was doing he lost her for a second time.
0	019LoX6HPT5pfJfM3ek0ID	Then after several months of no contact she started reaching out to him again, but she would not make dates.
0	019LoX6HPT5pfJfM3ek0ID	Since he had read my book twenty times at that point, he knew exactly what to do.

0	01HlRM5YlX1yOwCpB1CvLH	It is also the sum of three squares, 50 = 32 + 42 + 52, and the sum of four squares, 50 = 62 + 32 + 22 + 12.
0	01HlRM5YlX1yOwCpB1CvLH	In the action movie Speed, which depicts a Los Angeles cop (played by Keanu Reeves), who must rescue civilians on a bus that has a bomb rigged to it which will detonate if the bus's speed drops below 50 mph.  Sticking with roads, in New Zealand the speed limit on most urban roads is 50 kmph.
0	01HlRM5YlX1yOwCpB1CvLH	The phrase "fifty-fifty" commonly expresses something divided equally in two; in business this is often denoted as being the ultimate in equal partnership.
